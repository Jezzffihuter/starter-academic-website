Welcome! I am Chuyao (Julian) WANG, a passionate explorer in computational social science. I hold an M.Phil degree and an M.Sc. degree from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), and a B.A. degree from Shandong University. I am engaging in several independent and collaborative projects, which are broadly about human digital behavior, social networks and image-as-data.
