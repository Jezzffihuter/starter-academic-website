Welcome! I am a prospective Ph.D. in [Social Research Methods](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2022/MPhilPhD-Social-Research-Methods) (Applied Data Science) at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), supervised by [Prof. Patrick Sturgis](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Academic-Staff/Patrick-Sturgis/Patrick-Sturgis) and [Dr. Blake Miller](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Academic-Staff/Blake-Miller/Blake-Miller), and funded by [LSE Ph.D. Studentship](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/graduate/fees-and-funding/phd-studentships) (Â£160,000).

I am currently an M.Phil. student in [Social Science](https://sosc.hkust.edu.hk/teaching_learning/mphil_social_science) (Social Statistics) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) with [Postgraduate Studentship](https://pg.ust.hk/current-students/awards-and-grants/postgraduate-studentship) (HK$430,000), studying political communication and computational methods. I obtained an M.Sc. in [Global China Studies](https://shss.hkust.edu.hk/tpg/mgcs/index) from HKUST, and a B.A. in [History](http://en.history.sdu.edu.cn/info/1006/1013.htm) from Shandong University in China. I am grateful for my interdisciplinary background and diverse methods training. 

I have been conducting independent and collaborative studies, which are broadly about public opinion, social networks, and image as data. I presented and led a funded project in the [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science](https://sicss.io/) (2021). I enjoy meeting people and collaborating with others.

Beyond academia, my interests include economic history, hiking, socially significant music and petty discoveries in life. Brought up in the innovative city Shenzhen, I am conceived in progressive liberalism and cosmopolitanism.
