Welcome! This is Chuyao (Julian) WANG. I am currently an M.Phil. student in [Social Science](https://sosc.hkust.edu.hk/teaching_learning/mphil_social_science) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), studying political communication and computational methods. I obtained an M.Sc. in [Global China Studies](https://shss.hkust.edu.hk/tpg/mgcs/index) from HKUST, and a B.A. in [History](http://en.history.sdu.edu.cn/info/1006/1013.htm) from Shandong University. I am grateful for my interdisciplinary background and diverse methods training. 

I am conducting several independent and collaborative studies, which are broadly about human digital behavior, social networks and image-as-data. I am an alumni of the [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science](https://sicss.io/) in 2021 and have lead a project funded by Social Science Research Council. 

Please find my [CV](https://github.com/Jezzffihuter/starter-academic-website/blob/master/static/uploads/CV-ChuyaoWANG-Dec2021.pdf) here, and [email](<mailto: chuyao.wang@connect.ust.hk>) me for a chat if you are interested.
