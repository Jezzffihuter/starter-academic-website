Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in [Social Research Methods](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2022/MPhilPhD-Social-Research-Methods) (Applied Data Science) at LSE, supervised by [Prof. Patrick Sturgis](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Academic-Staff/Patrick-Sturgis/Patrick-Sturgis) and [Dr Daniel De Kadt](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Academic-Staff/Daniel-De-Kadt/Daniel-De-Kadt), and funded by [LSE Ph.D. Studentship](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/graduate/fees-and-funding/phd-studentships) (Â£170,000). 

My research projects are broadly about compuational social science, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence and society, and public opinion. I was selected to present at [American Political Science Association Annual Meeting](https://connect.apsanet.org/apsa2024/). I also led a funded project in the [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science](https://sicss.io/). My research endeavors have been supported by significant grants and awards, totaling over US$1,050,000. I hope to collaborate with scholars across communication, public policy, computer science, political science, sociology, and business, to craft research of substantial impact. My objective is to join leading universities as a pioneering researcher. 

I have acquired experience through internships in strategic consulting and investment analysis at the Boston Consulting Group, a Fintech startup, and a notable digital corporation. I harbor interests in vintage clothing, live music performances, hiking, and nuanced discoveries in life.

I received my M.Phil. in [Social Science](https://sosc.hkust.edu.hk/teaching_learning/mphil_social_science) (Social Statistics) with [Postgraduate Studentship](https://pg.ust.hk/current-students/awards-and-grants/postgraduate-studentship) (HK$430,000) and my M.Sc. in [Global China Studies](https://shss.hkust.edu.hk/tpg/mgcs/index) from HKUST. I obtained a B.A. in [History](http://en.history.sdu.edu.cn/info/1006/1013.htm) from Shandong University. I am grateful for my interdisciplinary background and diverse methods training. 

Please find my [CV](https://github.com/Jezzffihuter/starter-academic-website/blob/master/static/uploads/ChuyaoWANG-LSE-CV.pdf) (academic) or [Resume](https://github.com/Jezzffihuter/starter-academic-website/blob/master/static/uploads/ChuyaoWANG-LSE-Resume.pdf) (professional) here.
