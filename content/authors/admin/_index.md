Welcome! I am an incoming research student [](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/Study/PhD-Social-Research-Methods/PhD-Social-Research-Methods)at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) with a prospective Ph.D. in [Social Research Methods](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/Study/PhD-Social-Research-Methods/PhD-Social-Research-Methods) funded by [LSE PhD Studentship](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/graduate/fees-and-funding/phd-studentships) (Â£160,000). 

I am currently an M.Phil. student in [Social Science](https://sosc.hkust.edu.hk/teaching_learning/mphil_social_science) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), studying political communication and computational methods. I obtained an M.Sc. in [Global China Studies](https://shss.hkust.edu.hk/tpg/mgcs/index) from HKUST, and a B.A. in [History](http://en.history.sdu.edu.cn/info/1006/1013.htm) from Shandong University. I am grateful for my interdisciplinary background and diverse methods training. 

I have been conducting several independent and collaborative studies, which are broadly about public opinion, social networks, and image as data. I presented and led a funded project in the [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science](https://sicss.io/) (2021). I enjoy meeting people and collaborating with others.

Beyond academia, my interests include hiking, socially significant music and petty discoveries in life.
