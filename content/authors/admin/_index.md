Welcome! I am a prospective Ph.D. in [Social Research Methods](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/degree-programmes-2022/MPhilPhD-Social-Research-Methods) (Applied Data Science) at LSE, supervised by [Prof. Patrick Sturgis](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Academic-Staff/Patrick-Sturgis/Patrick-Sturgis) and [Dr. Blake Miller](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Academic-Staff/Blake-Miller/Blake-Miller), and funded by [LSE Ph.D. Studentship](https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/graduate/fees-and-funding/phd-studentships) (£160,000).

I received my M.Phil. in [Social Science](https://sosc.hkust.edu.hk/teaching_learning/mphil_social_science) (Social Statistics) with [Postgraduate Studentship](https://pg.ust.hk/current-students/awards-and-grants/postgraduate-studentship) (HK$430,000) and my M.Sc. in [Global China Studies](https://shss.hkust.edu.hk/tpg/mgcs/index) from HKUST. I obtained a B.A. in [History](http://en.history.sdu.edu.cn/info/1006/1013.htm) from Shandong University in China. I am grateful for my interdisciplinary background and diverse methods training. 

My research are broadly about s﻿ocial data science, public opinion, and social networks. I led a funded project in the [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science](https://sicss.io/) (2021). I﻿ gained internships in strategic consulting and investment analysis from Boston Consulting Group, ByteDance and the government.

I am conceived in liberty and cosmopolitanism. I enjoy meeting people and collaborating with others. My interests include reading, hiking, socially significant music and petty discoveries in life.
